- Allow users to download multiple files at once with the Download command.
- Allow users to enter entire file name, including the extension or just the
filename
- Comment shit
- Clean up code
- Create some sort of download progress bar.
    - Indicator / Progress Bar


- Make the dir output cleaner
    - Just space separate the items and '/' separate the lines
    - The client should handle parsing them nicely and the output
    - This also reduces transfer data size

- Create logging classes for both the server and the client

- Make sure I close appropriate streams when necessary
    - All streams should be closed somewhere.
